About:
Goddess Hair Salon is a landing page that was built for Goddess Hair Salon LLC, a black-owned natural hair salon based in Bronx, New York. They were in need of a new website to attract new clients, and I was contacted to create a brand new website.

## Lessons Learned

There are many lessons I've learned during this process. To cater to my client's requests, I've learned many different CSS tricks, styles, and techniques. The biggest lesson I learned was how to master responsive site design. Prior to building this project I had trouble with making a website responsive across various devices, but now, I've mastered how to make a website responsive across all devices.
